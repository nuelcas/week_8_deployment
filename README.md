# Deploying the Expense Tracker Application
Description:
In this week, you will deploy the Expense Tracker Application to a live server using various deployment strategies and hosting platforms. You will learn about different server setups and deployment methods, and gain practical experience in deploying a full-stack application to a production environment. This aims to familiarize you with the deployment process and prepare you for deploying real-world applications in the future.

Requirements:
Research on Deployment Strategies and Hosting Platforms:
    Explore different deployment strategies such as traditional server hosting, cloud hosting, serverless architecture, and containerization.
    Research popular hosting platforms like AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Heroku, and DigitalOcean.
    Understand the pros and cons of each deployment strategy and hosting platform.
Choosing a Deployment Method:
    Select a deployment method and hosting platform based on your project requirements, budget, scalability needs, and technical expertise.
    Decide whether to deploy the application manually or using automated deployment tools (e.g., Docker, CI/CD pipelines).
Setting up the Live Server Environment:
    Set up a live server environment on your chosen hosting platform.
    Configure the server with necessary software dependencies (e.g., Node.js, MySQL).
Deploying the Expense Tracker Application:
    Prepare your application for deployment by optimizing frontend and backend code, configuring environment variables, and handling production-specific settings.
    Deploy the frontend of the Expense Tracker Application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the live server.
    Deploy the backend of the Expense Tracker Application (Node.js with Express.js) to the live server.
    Configure database connections and environment variables to ensure seamless communication between frontend and backend components.
Testing and Verification:
    Test the deployed application to ensure all functionalities are working as expected in the live environment.
    Perform cross-browser testing and compatibility testing to ensure the application behaves consistently across different browsers and devices.
    Verify data integrity and security measures in the live environment.
Submission:
    Submit the link to your GitHub repository for evaluation through the GitHub Classrooms assignment.
